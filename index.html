<!--============ ABOUT ME ===================================================== -->

       <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
        I am a strategic product executive who builds intelligent, scalable solutions at the intersection of AI, Field Service, Digital Commerce, and Cloud SaaS. Over the past 15+ years, I’ve guided global teams and complex enterprise programs across Oracle, HP, and high-growth SaaS environments—earning a reputation for transforming ambiguity into strategy, and strategy into measurable business outcomes.
        <p>
        My work sits at the core of how organizations operate. I’ve led the design and delivery of cloud-native products that streamline field service operations, modernize B2B eCommerce, and integrate seamlessly with ERP ecosystems such as Infor, Karmak, SAP, and DST. I understand how data, workflow automation, and customer experience come together to create meaningful competitive advantage.
        <p>
        With hands-on expertise in Oracle Field Service (OFS/OFSC), AI-driven automation, and AWS/Azure integration, I specialize in turning complex operational and technical landscapes into intuitive, high-performing products. My teams and I have delivered results that matter40% efficiency improvements, double-digit revenue acceleration, and retention rates above 80% by staying grounded in customer needs and aligned with business strategy.
        <p>
        What I enjoy most is building clarity, collaboration, and momentum across engineering, design, sales, and customer success. I lead with empathy, analytical rigor, and a bias for action, ensuring that every product decision moves the business forward while enabling teams to perform at their highest level.
        <p>
        I am driven by the belief that great products don’t just solve problems—they elevate organizations, empower users, and create long-term value. That is the mindset I bring to every role, every customer, and every product I help shape.
