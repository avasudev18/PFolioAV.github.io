       <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
        I am a strategic product executive who builds intelligent, scalable solutions at the intersection of AI, Field Service, Digital Commerce, and Cloud SaaS. Over the past 15+ years, I’ve guided global teams and complex enterprise programs across Oracle, HP, and high-growth SaaS environments—earning a reputation for transforming ambiguity into strategy, and strategy into measurable business outcomes.
        <p>
        My work sits at the core of how organizations operate. I’ve led the design and delivery of cloud-native products that streamline field service operations, modernize B2B eCommerce, and integrate seamlessly with ERP ecosystems such as Infor, Karmak, SAP, and DST. I understand how data, workflow automation, and customer experience come together to create meaningful competitive advantage.
        <p>
        With hands-on expertise in Oracle Field Service (OFS/OFSC), AI-driven automation, and AWS/Azure integration, I specialize in turning complex operational and technical landscapes into intuitive, high-performing products. My teams and I have delivered results that matter 40% efficiency improvements, double-digit revenue acceleration, and retention rates above 80% by staying grounded in customer needs and aligned with business strategy.
        <p>
        What I enjoy most is building clarity, collaboration, and momentum across engineering, design, sales, and customer success. I lead with empathy, analytical rigor, and a bias for action, ensuring that every product decision moves the business forward while enabling teams to perform at their highest level.
        <p>
        I am driven by the belief that great products don’t just solve problems—they elevate organizations, empower users, and create long-term value. That is the mindset I bring to every role, every customer, and every product I help shape.

         <h3>Executive Leadership in Customer Success & Growth</h3>
        <p> 
        As Director of Customer Success, I inherited a mid-market portfolio operating in a high-growth environment with rising customer volume, increasing operational complexity, and inconsistent engagement cadence. Resolution cycles averaged 35 days, automation was limited, and there was no unified performance framework to govern service quality, retention risk, or expansion readiness.
        </p>
        <p>
         I established a structured engagement model across 20 active tenants, introducing predictable weekly, biweekly, monthly, and quarterly cadences. I designed and deployed a weighted performance framework governing execution across CSAT, resolution speed, escalation control, and proactive actions, reinforced by a 30-60-90 execution model for continuous value realization. In parallel, I led fully automated HDA ingestion, expanded analytics deployments, and drove Generative AI readiness classification across 25 customers, ensuring the portfolio scaled with data-driven precision.
         </p>
         <p>Under my leadership as Director of Customer Success, the organization achieved zero SLA breaches, reduced average resolution time from 35 days to under 10, and established a highly predictable operating rhythm across the entire mid-market portfolio. Customer Success now operates as a scalable revenue engine and churn-prevention system, with the business strategically positioned for future-ready, AI-enabled growth.

        <h3>Problem</h3>
        <p>
          HbA1C is a lagging indicator (updates every 2–3 months). Users trying to lower A1C via lifestyle changes
          lack real-time feedback, receive conflicting “healthy eating” advice, and often lose confidence or over-restrict.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>No immediate signal linking daily meals to A1C outcomes</li>
          <li>Generic guidance fails to explain derailment patterns</li>

      </article>

      <article class="cs-block">
        <h3>Hypothesis</h3>
        <p>
          If we model A1C as a function of behavioral patterns (not individual foods),
          we can forecast trends before labs, identify high-leverage actions, and improve adherence via interpretability.

        <h3>Outcome</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Stable, downward A1C trend with weekly averages remaining inside the confidence band</li>
          <li>Early forecasting of crossing A1C 6.0 by mid-January (trend-based)</li>

        <h3>Learnings</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Interpretability beats complexity for sustained behavior change</li>
          <li>Weekly averages are the right KPI; daily noise is not actionable</li>
          <li>Fiber quality (veg/avocado/seeds) outperforms “whole grains” for glucose stability</li>
          <li>Protein must be paired with fat to reduce insulin spike duration</li>
          <li>Small, repeatable rules prevent derailment better than strict restriction</li>

           "SmartGardener" is a personalized gardening assistant app designed to empower home gardeners with intelligent insights and practical tools to effectively manage both indoor and outdoor plants. By leveraging real-time location data, seasonal patterns, and plant health diagnostics, the app provides tailored recommendations to optimize plant care and ensure healthy growth.
           Throughout the product development lifecycle, I strategically incorporated generative AI tools at each stage to accelerate ideation, improve feature design, and elevate the overall user experience. <br>
